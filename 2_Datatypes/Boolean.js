// The boolean data type can only have two possible values:
// 1. true
// 2. false

//Here are some examples of boolean data types in JavaScript:
const isRaining = true;

const isSunny = false;


// The boolean data type is often used in conditional statements to control the flow of a program.

const isRaining = true;

if (isRaining) {
  console.log("Don't forget to bring an umbrella!");
}
