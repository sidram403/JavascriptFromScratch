// In JavaScript, an object is a complex data type that represents a collection of related data or functionality.

// Here's an example of an object in JavaScript:

const person = {firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', age: 30, isStudent: true,}

// Here's an example of accessing the firstName property of the person object using dot notation:
console.log(person.firstName); // output: "John"

// And here's an example of accessing the firstName property of the person object using bracket notation:
console.log(person['firstName']); // output: "John"
