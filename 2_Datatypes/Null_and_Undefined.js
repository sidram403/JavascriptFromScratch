// In JavaScript, 'null' is a primitive data type that represents the intentional absence of any object value.

// Here's an example of using the null value in JavaScript:
let myVar = null;  // the variable myVar is assigned the null value, which indicates that it has no object value.

console.log(myVar); // output: null

// In JavaScript, 'undefined' is a special value that is used to represent an uninitialized or missing value.

// Here's an example of using the undefined value in JavaScript:

let myVar;  // the variable myVar has been declared but not assigned a value, so it has the value undefined.

console.log(myVar); // output: undefined

let myVar = undefined;

console.log(myVar); // output: undefined
